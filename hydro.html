        <h2>What is Hydro Energy?</h2>
        <p>
          Hydro energy, also known as hydropower, is the energy produced from
          the movement of water. It is one of the oldest and most widely used
          renewable energy sources.
        </p>

        <h2>How Does Hydro Energy Work?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Water flows from a high elevation to a lower elevation, creating
            kinetic energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            The flowing water turns the blades of a turbine, generating
            mechanical energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            The turbine is connected to a generator, which converts mechanical
            energy into electricity.
          </li>
          <li>
            The generated electricity is distributed through power grids for use
            in homes and industries.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Hydro Energy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Renewable:</b> Water is a naturally replenishing resource.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Reliable:</b> Hydropower plants provide a consistent and stable
            energy supply.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Low Emissions:</b> Does not produce greenhouse gases or air
            pollution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Storage Capability:</b> Dams can store water for future energy
            production.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Hydro Energy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Generating electricity for homes and industries</li>
          <li>Providing water supply for irrigation</li>
          <li>Flood control and water management</li>
          <li>Supporting hybrid energy systems</li>
        </ul>
